Reasoning Behind Proactive Home Network Monitoring
Imagine a home where tech just works. No more frantic calls to your ISP when the internet goes down, no more wondering why your smart devices are suddenly unresponsive. Proactive home network monitoring, powered by a local Large Language Model (LLM), moves us closer to this reality.

Traditionally, home network troubleshooting is reactive. We notice a problem – slow internet, a dropped video call – and then we scramble to diagnose the cause. This can be frustrating and time-consuming, especially for non-technical users.

By implementing proactive monitoring, we shift from reacting to anticipating. We can gain real-time insights into crucial aspects of our home network, such as:

Internet Connection Status: Detect outages or intermittent connectivity issues before they significantly impact your online activities. Imagine getting an alert that your internet connection is unstable, allowing you to troubleshoot or contact your ISP preemptively.
DNS Name Resolution: Identify problems with your DNS server, which can lead to websites not loading correctly. Early detection can prevent frustrating browsing experiences.
Network Traffic Patterns: Understand how different devices are using your bandwidth. This can help identify unusual activity or bandwidth hogs that might be impacting performance.
Device Connectivity: Monitor the status of your connected devices, ensuring your smart home gadgets, printers, and other peripherals are online and functioning as expected.
Integrating a local LLM into this monitoring system takes it a step further. Instead of just raw data, you can ask natural language questions about your network's behavior and receive insightful answers. For example:

"Why has my internet speed been slow this morning?"
"Which device has used the most bandwidth in the last hour?"
"Are there any unusual traffic patterns on my network?"
This conversational interface democratizes network management, making it accessible even to those without deep technical expertise. It transforms network monitoring from a cryptic dashboard into an intelligent assistant that understands your needs and provides actionable insights.

2. Requirement on Setup: VyOS Software Router Configuration
To embark on this journey, you'll need a router capable of exporting network flow data (NetFlow) and supporting SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). While some consumer routers offer limited versions of these features, a more robust solution is often required for detailed monitoring.

You've made an excellent choice with VyOS, an open-source network operating system that can be installed on a mini PC. This provides granular control and the necessary features for our project.

Here's how you can configure NetFlow and SNMP on VyOS:
